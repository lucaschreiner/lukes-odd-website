Hi. My name is Luca, I'm just a regular 16 years old High School student from Germany, and I am a nerd and I love CATS!!!. I'm currently working on this website (My personal blog). And I'm learning Java, HTML, Markdown, and yaml. I wanted to make this website because I am programming since 1 year now, and I don't really had a project to start with, so I decided to start my personal website as a Project to learn HTML (with the help of Markdown) and CSS. My hobbies are playing video games(nothin' special), playing chess(like I said, i'm a nerd), and programming, but of course I do sports such as table tennis. I also like to watch many kind of movies and anime. My favourite movie of all time is **back to the future** (best film ever).
