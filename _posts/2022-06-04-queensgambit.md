So, as you guys know from my about page, I love playing chess and i'm playing mostly the queen's gambit opening. The opening got his hype mostly from the new Series on Netflix called "The Queen's Gambit". I've already watched this series a while ago, so I thought, in this Post i'm going to show how to play the queen's gambit in chess and counter it.

**Note:** This tutorial is for people who know the chess rules, tactics, strategies and the Chess Notation.

## Basic Moves

To start the Queen's Gambit, White moves his pawn forward on ``d4``

![Pawn](https://simplifychess.com/queens-gambit-frame/img/desk2-3.svg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Then Black responds by moving his pawn forward on ``d5``.
After that White counters by moving his pawn to ``c4``

Now there's two options either black takes the pawn on ``c4`` or decline the gambit and push his pawn on ``e6`` or ``Nf6``.
The idea behind the Queen's Gambit is: White is trying to exchange his wing pawn (the c-pawn) for a centre pawn (Black's d-pawn). Let's say black accepts the gambit and takes the pawn on ``c4``. If that happens white can either move it's (e-pawn) to ``e3`` or ``e4``.

Then the white bishop attacks the black pawn. So, despite its name, the Queen's Gambit is not a true gambit, since Black cannot hold the pawn very long. Let me show you...

White can just free up his bishop. And if black is still gonna try his best to protect this pawn the game would be going like this..

![Pawn](https://simplifychess.com/queens-gambit-frame/img/trying-to-keep-pawn/b5.svg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

![Pawn](https://simplifychess.com/queens-gambit-frame/img/trying-to-keep-pawn/a4.svg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

![Pawn](https://simplifychess.com/queens-gambit-frame/img/trying-to-keep-pawn/c6.svg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

![Pawn](https://simplifychess.com/queens-gambit-frame/img/trying-to-keep-pawn/bxc5.svg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

![Pawn](https://simplifychess.com/queens-gambit-frame/img/trying-to-keep-pawn/cxb5.svg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

![Pawn](https://simplifychess.com/queens-gambit-frame/img/trying-to-keep-pawn/qf3.svg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

![Pawn](https://simplifychess.com/queens-gambit-frame/img/trying-to-keep-pawn/qxa8.svg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

And now white can win a free rook, which is very good. 
So not everyone does play this way the queen's gambit and not every does accept it, that's why the queen's gambit opening is divided into three major categories based on Black's response.

1. The Queen's Gambit Accepted (QGA)
2. The Queen's Gambit Declined (QGD)
3. And the Slav Defense

This was the quick tutorial on how to play the Queen's Gambit (Accepted), Soon I will do a more detailed and advanced version on this post. I hope this helped you to understand a chess opening and play it. Thanks for reading this post.
